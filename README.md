# timer_app

## Description
This is a minimal timer app built as a side project, focused purely on experimenting with UI theme changes. 
It lets you switch between light, dark, and custom themes while running a simple timer. 
The goal isnâ€™t complex functionality, but exploring design aesthetics and smooth theme transitions.
